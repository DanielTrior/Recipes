        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Eton mess is a super quick and easy British dessert made in minutes by combining chunks of meringue cookies with whipped cream and fresh berries. Spoon into glasses for a sensational summer treat!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>4 store-bought meringue cookies</li>
                <li>12 ounces ripe raspberries</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce and layering that with noodles and cheese into a casserole. Here's the run-down:</p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Beat cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks form.</li>
                <li>Break meringue cookies into bite-sized chunks and add to whipped cream; fold in berries lightly with a metal spoon until you see streaks of dark pink but still retain some chunks of meringue.</li>
                <li>Spoon Eton mess into four glass dishes and serve.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    </p>

    <p>Best served straight away or chill the berry-cream mixture and add meringue pieces just before serving so they retain their crunch.</p>
    <p>Try it with ripe strawberries or peaches in the summer, or stewed rhubarb in spring.</p>
