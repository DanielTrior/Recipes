Recipes exercise from the Odin Project

I made the first Odin Project exercise where i used all i learned from HTML and GIT.

I added 3 different recipes where they content is slightly different with more o less images, and sections. I made a list of the recipes and added a style to dont see the dots before each one of the images, used different types of headings and modify some and used bold to mark some text as important.

Hope you like it!
